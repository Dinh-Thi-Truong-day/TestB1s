  <h2>Reading Part 3</h2>
  <p><strong>Polly Murray, explorer</strong></p>
  <p>
    In a way, I've been an explorer all my life. My earliest memory is of a family camping holiday in Italy when I was six. 
    We put up our tent at 4,000 meters! I remember walking down the mountain, holding my father's trousers to prevent me from 
    falling over the rock edge. I didn't have any fear of heights then. Now I rather like looking down and feeling a bit afraid.<br><br>
    I spend every winter in the mountains teaching skiing. The rest of the time I go exploring. This year, I've tested out an 
    adventure holiday in Patagonia in Argentina for a travel company and helped a TV company make a nature film in the jungle in Peru. 
    My most exciting trip has been one I took with my friend Tania. We sailed from Greenland across Baffin Bay to Bylot Island, which 
    is just ice, mountains and polar bears. We crossed the island on foot in seven days but, when we got to the other side, the boat 
    wasn't there to meet us as planned. There was a terrific storm and it couldn't get to the shore, which meant we had to wait two extra 
    days. We had run out of food and were very hungry, and very nervous about the polar bears.<br><br>
    To be an explorer, you need to be cool-headed. The minute you start to panic everything goes wrong, especially if you're climbing. 
    I haven't had any serious accidents or injuries although I once had terrible toothache in Antarctica in the middle of nowhere. 
    I just had to carry on in spite of the pain. I think I am a strong person and I can't imagine having any other kind of life.
